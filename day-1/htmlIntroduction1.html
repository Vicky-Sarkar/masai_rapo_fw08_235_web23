<h1>b tag</h1>
<p>
	The<b> HTML element is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted
		special importance. This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in
		boldface.
</p>

<h1> i tag</h1>
<p>The <i> tag defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.
	The <i> tag is often used to indicate a technical term, a phrase from another language, a thought, a ship name, etc.</p>


<h1>u tag</h1>
<p>
	The <u> tag represents some text that is unarticulated and styled differently from normal text, such as misspelled words
		or proper names in Chinese text. The content inside is typically displayed with an underline. You can change this
		with CSS (see example below).
</p>


<h1> select tag</h1>
<p>
	The select HTML element represents a control that provides a menu of options.
</p>

<h1>button</h1>
<p>
	The button HTML element is an interactive element activated by a user with a mouse, keyboard, finger, voice command,
		or other assistive technology. Once activated, it then performs a programmable action, such as submitting a form or
		opening a dialog.
</p>

<h1>hr tag</h1>
<p>
	The
	<hr> HTML element represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements: for example, a change of scene in a
	story, or a shift of topic within a section.
</p>

<h1>br tag</h1>
<p>
	The <br> HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return). It is useful for writing a poem or an address,
	where the division of lines is significant.
